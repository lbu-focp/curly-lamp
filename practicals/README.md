# Practical Sheet Programs

Store your programs from the "weekly" practical sheets in these folders.

You can use any file names you like, as long as it is obvious what programs that contain. It would be a good idea to include a ``README.md`` file in each folder to show clearly what you have done. This will also give you some practice in writing Markdown files.

The first folder (``00-first-programs``) should contain the code developed in the first two weekly practicals.

Use the final folder (``99-additional-work``) if you have completed any other programs from other sources, such as books or YouTube videos. Use any folder structure you like there but you should include a ``README.md`` to document what is included.

*Note: There is an empty ``.gitkeep`` file in some of these folders. This is the standard way to persuade Git to include an empty folder in a repo. You can delete ``.gitkeep`` when you have added content to a folder, or just leave it there; it makes no difference. Either way, you should not edit it.*
